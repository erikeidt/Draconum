	Draconum is a set of C# projects.
	Most of them have a main, which tests the implementation.
	Each project builds on the others: 
		the initial concerns expression parsing, 
		latter statement parsing, 
		finally code generation.

(1) Expression Generator Tool

This is a simple tool to validate tokens in unary and binary modes.

This tool generates some C# files (.gen.cs) into the expression parser project directory

(2)

Expression Parser

Parses complex expressions using my own high-performance parsing method.

(3)

Statement Parser

Adds parsing of statements, and uses the expression parser.

(4)

Code Generator

Does evaluations for value, assignment, conditional branch, and side-effects.
Includes the short-ciruit operators &&, ||.

Uses a simple stack machine for the instruction set.
